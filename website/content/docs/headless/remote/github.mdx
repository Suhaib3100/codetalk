description: Use GitHub as a remote content source

<Callout type="warn" title="Deprecated">

    We now recommend to fetch MDX files from a GitHub repo directly and trigger a static build.
    You may also use other content sources like Sanity.

</Callout>

MDX Remote offers a GitHub integration, it allows you to use a
GitHub repository as the content source of your documentation.

## When to use it?

When your docs site is too large for the built-in content sources (e.g. Fumadocs MDX), building all pages in build time takes too much time.
For example, you have a docs with more than 1000 MDX files under the project.

For smaller docs, Fumadocs MDX may be a better option.

## Features

With MDX Remote GitHub, in production, your documentation will be automatically updated
whenever you make changes to the content in your GitHub repository.

You don't need to re-build or re-deploy the entire docs site when the content updates.

## Setup

In `source.ts`, change the usage of `loader` to:

```ts
import { createSourceAuto } from '@fumadocs/mdx-remote/github';
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';
import { cache } from 'react';

export const getDocs = cache(async () => {
  return loader({
    source: await createSourceAuto({
      github: {
  owner: 'Suhaib3100',
  repo: 'Codetalk',
        directory: 'examples/remote-mdx/content',
        treeSha: 'main',
        accessToken: process.env.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
      },
    }),
    rootDir: 'docs',
    baseUrl: '/docs',
  });
});
```

Then, change all usages to the original output to `await getDocs()`.

The `createSourceAuto` function fetches the file tree (file structure), which is required to generate the page tree.
Depending on the environment (`process.env.NODE_ENV`):

| Environment | Source                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Production  | use the GitHub API and fetch Git Tree. |
| Development | use the file system directly.          |

To dedupe the requests, we will use React `cache`.

### Force a Source?

You can use the `from` option to force a source.

```ts
import { createSourceAuto } from '@fumadocs/mdx-remote/github';

await createSourceAuto({
  // always use GitHub
  from: 'github',
});
```

Be careful, this may break the MDX Remote development server.

### Hot Reload

MDX Remote provides a development server for implementing hot reload under development environments.
It uses a file watcher to detect for local content changes, and notify the client via WebSocket.

Initialize the server in your `next.config.mjs`:

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../examples/remote-mdx/next.config.mjs",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "js",
    "meta": "title=\"next.config.mjs\""
  }
}
```

Add the hot reload component to client, it's recommended to add it to a layout.

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../examples/remote-mdx/app/docs/layout.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "title=\"app/docs/layout.tsx\""
  }
}
```

### Page

In your docs page, you have to manually resolve the file content, and compile it using the built-in MDX Compiler.

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../examples/remote-mdx/app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "title=\"app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\""
  }
}
```

### Search

MDX Remote provides a simple way to build search indexes.
It should be executed every time the content is changed to ensure search indexes are up-to-date.

```ts
import { buildSearchIndexes } from '@fumadocs/mdx-remote/github';

async function main() {
  const output = await buildSearchIndexes({
    directory: './content/docs',
    baseUrl: '/docs',
  });

  // handle the output search indexes
}
```

## Deploy

MDX Remote GitHub uses Webhook to receive notifications from GitHub and revalidates cache.

In the settings of your GitHub repository, go to the Webhook Tab and create a new Webhook:

![Webhook Settings](/docs/webhook.png)

Remember to give it a secret, it will be used later.

In your app, add the following route handler.

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../examples/remote-mdx/app/api/github/webhook/route.ts",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "ts",
    "meta": "title=\"app/api/github/webhook/route.ts\""
  }
}
```

Now you can deploy your app.

For projects hosted on Vercel, or other platforms which provides a GitHub integration, **skip the deployment step when the commit only affects your content**.
Otherwise, the optimization of MDX Remote cannot take effect.

On Vercel, this can be done with [Ignore Build Step](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#ignored-build-step).

## Deep Dive

Internally, we use the Next.js cache. It allows us to incrementally update the
documentation in real-time, avoiding rebuilding the entire documentation every
time a change is made.
