<Callout type="warn" title="Deprecated">
  Use a route handler to export build time information instead.
</Callout>

## Usage

Enable it from global config.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export default defineConfig({
  generateManifest: true,
});
```

During a production build (`next build`), Fumadocs MDX will output a manifest file in `.source/manifest.json`.
You can use it to collect build information.

### What is It?

The manifest file contains the compiled info of collection entries.
This includes their frontmatter, `structuredData` and `toc` (Table of Contents).

You can check the type definitions to see all available properties.

```ts
import type { Manifest } from 'fumadocs-mdx';
```

### Read Manifest

You can read the file after the build is finished.

```ts
import type { Manifest } from 'fumadocs-mdx';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const manifest = JSON.parse(
  readFileSync('.source/manifest.json').toString(),
) as Manifest;
```
